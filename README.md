# Abstract

This paper focuses on presenting the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, a stochastic method that has been inspired by certain animal behaviors in biology such as birds or fishes. The principle of this algorithm is to find a global optimum as fast as possible by analyzing its neighborhood and avoiding diverging paths. Among other optimization methods and depending on the context, it is one of the most efficient algorithms, especially for highly non-linear functions, as others have difficulties to find the global optimum. This paper extends the standard algorithm particularly by building algorithms capable of minimizing single or dual functions with constraints.
